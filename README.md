The steps to import the JAR file can vary depending on the IDE you are using. Below are general steps that apply to most IDEs:

1. Download the jar file from the master branch of the GitHub repository
2. Open your IDE and start a new project or open an existing one.
3. Go to the project settings or configuration.
4. Look for an option to add or manage libraries, often found in a 'Dependencies' or 'Libraries' section.
5. Use the option to add an external JAR and navigate to the location where you downloaded the `.jar` file.
6. Select the file and apply the changes.

After these steps, the JAR file should be integrated into your project, and you can start using its functionalities.
